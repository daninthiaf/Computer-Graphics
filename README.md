Projects using OpenGL

A few of my projects using OpenGL. 

SUMMARY

Fireworks:
This displays an image of fireworks done by ysing a random number of numbers for the number of fireworks, number of colors and the locations (x, y,z).

Blockworld:
This is a more interactive program with there being 3D blocks for the user to stack on top of the others and it allows for the user to navigate the blockworld. 
The avatar being controlled by the user has certain constraints in the form of if statements so that it does not go straight through the blocks.

Gouraud:
This is to show more of a realistic terrain by utilizing Gouraud shading and a distaince weighted diffusion deflection model. Utilization of 2D
arrays and vertex color calculations. 

Mazeworld:
This includes reading in a maze from an ASCII input file. The maze is read into a 2D array. Then read the texture images so that the maza can be
displayed with various texture types (e.g. brick, rock, grass). Again, if statements are used to help with player navigation. Controls are
implemented so the the user may move forward, backward, left & right. 

RayTrace:
This program displays multiple spheres of different colors with more realistic attributes (such as lighting, shadowing etc.). Here, ray tracing is utilized. We use six classes: ColorRGB (color values), Point3D(3D points), Vector3D(vector points), Ray3D(point samples 
along the ray), Sphere3D(defines a sphere centered at a location), Phong(performs Phong shading for a given point).
